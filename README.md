# Personal catalogue application, made on React

This simple app allows you to enter various texts and headers and save them in side-bar for further open and read purposes
It's only my study project, nothing really big and smart, very small spectre of opportunities, but i hope its only beginning :)

To make it work, get the code of this project on your pc, using command      git clone https://github.com/ConstantineButenko/personal-storage.git
Then go to your terminal and enter         npm start react
